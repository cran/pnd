Description: Calculation of numerical derivatives through
    finite-difference approximations with parallel capabilities and optimal
    step-size selection to improve accuracy. These functions facilitate
    efficient computation of derivatives, gradients, Jacobians, and Hessians,
    allowing for more evaluations to reduce the mathematical and machine errors.
    Designed for compatibility with the 'numDeriv' package,
    which has not received updates in several years, it introduces advanced features
    such as computing derivatives of arbitrary order, improving
    the accuracy of Hessian approximations by avoiding repeated differencing,
    and parallelising slow functions on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
